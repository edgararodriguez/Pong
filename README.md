# Pong
In this project my lab partner Caleb and I used Javascript, CSS, and html to create a game of pong
# Function
This game is a multiplayer game that is meant to be played on one device. It is made to play in full screen.
We added pysics so the ball would bounce off the board. The more you are up the more difficult it becomes for the other player to score.
